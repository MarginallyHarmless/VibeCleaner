# Privacy Policy — Clean My Photos

**Last updated:** February 9, 2026

## Overview

Clean My Photos ("the App") is a photo gallery management app that helps you organize and declutter your photo collection. The App operates entirely on your device. We do not collect, store, transmit, or share any of your personal data.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect any data.** The App does not:

- Send your photos, videos, or any files to external servers
- Collect usage analytics or crash reports
- Track your location or device activity
- Use cookies or similar tracking technologies
- Share any information with third parties

All photo processing, duplicate detection, and quality analysis happen locally on your device.

## Permissions

The App requests the following permissions to function:

| Permission | Why it's needed |
|---|---|
| **Photo & Video Access** (READ_MEDIA_IMAGES, READ_MEDIA_VIDEO) | To display your photos and videos for review and organization |
| **Storage Access** (READ/WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE on older Android versions) | To read and manage photos on devices running Android 12 or earlier |
| **All Files Access** (MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE) | To move photos between albums without requiring confirmation for each file. This is optional — the App works without it but may show additional confirmation dialogs |
| **Notifications** (POST_NOTIFICATIONS) | To show progress when scanning for duplicate or low-quality photos in the background |

You can revoke any permission at any time through your device's Settings. Some features may not work without the required permissions.

## Local Storage

The App stores the following data locally on your device:

- **App preferences** (e.g., premium status, settings) in Android SharedPreferences
- **Photo scan results** (duplicate detection hashes, quality scores) in a local database

This data never leaves your device and is deleted when you uninstall the App.

## In-App Purchases

The App offers an optional one-time premium purchase processed through Google Play. Purchase transactions are handled entirely by Google Play and are subject to [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy). We do not have access to your payment information.

## Children's Privacy

The App does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. The App contains no age-restricted content and is rated for all ages.

## Changes to This Policy

If we update this privacy policy, we will post the revised version here with an updated date. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
