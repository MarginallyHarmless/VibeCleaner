## Full Description

Cleaning up your photo gallery shouldn't feel like a chore. Stash or Trash lets you quickly go through your photos with simple swipes — right to keep, left to delete. Undo anytime if you change your mind.

**Browse your way:**
- By date — start from your oldest or newest photos
- By album — clean up one folder at a time
- All media — see everything at once
- Random shuffle mode

**Smart Scanner:**
The built-in scanner detects duplicates, blurry photos, too-dark shots, and screenshots. Review what it finds and delete in bulk.

**Organize as you go:**
Move photos between albums while swiping — no need to switch to a file manager.

**Track your progress:**
Built-in stats show how many photos you've reviewed, kept, and deleted.

**Privacy:**
Everything happens on your device. No data collection, no cloud, no accounts.

## Design Decisions

- **Tone**: Fun & casual
